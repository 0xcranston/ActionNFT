# Action NFT 1

Action NFT 1 will be raising a refundable bug bounty towards the cause of striking the odious cryptocurrency language from the unrelated infrastructure bill.

Two types of mints:

- Common mint, several exist (or can mint many)
- Auction mint, top 5 get the piece at the end

Refundable for 30 days after end is announced

## Installation

To deploy, simply `brownie run deploy -I`

This places all needed artifacts in the clients folder.  To run the frontend, go to clients folder and run `npm run install`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`
